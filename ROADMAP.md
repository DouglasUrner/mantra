# Road Map

This is the Mantra Roadmap and a rough timeline on when we can have these. These are just planned items(not started yet) and we are really looking your help to make them a success.

> If you want to start working on these or looking for more information, just open a new issue.

* Mantra version 0.2.0 (Jan 3rd week)
    - Add support for Modules based file system
    - Add support for Module distribution via NPM
    - Loosen up a bit on the library usage on UI components
    - Shape up the spec a bit
    - Getting Ready for SSR

* Mantra Yeoman Generator (Jan 4th week)

* Real world open source app on Mantra (Early Feb)
    - We are starting to build the app powered under BulletProof Meteor with Mantra. We'll make it opensource as a reference app.

* Mantra Tutor (Mid Feb)
    - A BulletProof Meteor like course to learn about Mantra as well React, ES2015 and testing in general.

* Mantra Linter (Early March)
    - To lint mantra specific stuff and make sure you are following Mantra rules.

* Examples on using Mantra with different state management tools like:
    - Redux
    - Relay
    - Lokka/GraphQL
    - Rx.js Observables based data sources

    - Something like UI Harness introduces by Respondly: http://www.uiharness.com/quick-start/
