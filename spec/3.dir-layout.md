# Directory Layout & Naming Conventions

In Mantra, we enforce a common directory structure. That's the core part of the maintainability of any app.

Here’s more information about Mantra’s directory structure.

## Server Side

On the server side we have three main directories. They are:

```
* configs
* methods
* publications
```

Other than that, we have a single js file called `main.js` that you can use to initialize any configuration in the `configs` directory.

In the method and publications directory, you can create a file for each feature and put methods/publications inside them.

When naming publications and methods, they should follow this naming convention:

```
[filename].[name]
```

For example, if we need to create a method called `create` inside the `posts` file, we name it `create.posts`.

## Client Side

All the client-side files are put into the `client` directory under following directory layout.

```
* actions
* components
* containers
* configs
* libraries
* main.js
```

### main.js

`main.js` is the entry point of the app and it will initialize the app. Usually, it will load routes.

### actions

This directory contains all the actions in our app. Here's a sample directory layout inside it.

```
* posts.js
* index.js
* tests
    - posts.js
```

`posts.js` is an ES2015 module that exports a JavaScript object with actions. For example, here's a simple action module.

```js
export default {
  create({Meteor, LocalState, FlowRouter}, title, content) {
    //...
  },

  clearErrors({LocalState}) {
    //...
  }
};
```

Then, in the `index.js`, we import all the action modules and aggregate all actions.

```js
import posts from './posts';

export default {
  posts
};
```

In the tests directory, we have tests for each action module.

### components

Components contain the whole UI of our app. It has a directory layout like this:

```
* layouts.main
    - index.jsx
    - style.css
    - tests
        + index.jsx
* post
    - index.jsx
    - style.css
    - tests
        + index.jsx
```

A single directory should expose a single UI component. It's acceptable to have more than one component inside the directory, but they should be helping components and you should not access them from the outside.

You can have CSS files and other resources inside each UI component directory.

Just like in actions, we have a tests directory that contains our tests.

Mantra enforces a flat directory structure where you can name directories with dots(.) like `layouts.main`.

### containers

This directory contains set of modules, with each module representing a single container. Containers should follow a flat directory layout and use dot(.) to group common components.

Here's a common directory layout:

```
* post.js
* postlist.js
* tests
    - post.js
    - postlist.js
```

### configs

This directory contains all the configurations we need to invoke in our app. They should not invoke themselves, but they should export a function to access from the `client/main.js` and load it.

Usually, this is the place to configure routes and initialize the application context.

### libraries

This directory contains a set of modules that have a set of utility functions. These modules should be provided to the app via the application context, so you need to require these modules from the application context.
