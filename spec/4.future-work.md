# Future Work

Mantra is a draft and there may be a lot of missing pieces and improvements we can do. We've currently identified following features are important to Mantra and will be available in near future.

## Mantra Modules

Mantra modules help you to put actions, UI components and containers related to common functionality into a single place. You can publish them to NPM and share with others.

Note: We don't have a proper way to do this now. Try to do experiments and [share](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra/issues/3) your experience with us.

## Server Side Rendering (SSR)

It's extremely possible to do SSR with Mantra. We are trying to this with tool agnostic manner, but the reference implementation will be based on FlowRouter SSR.
